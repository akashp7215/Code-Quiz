# Code-Quiz
As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This quiz was designed with a timer starting from 75 seconds and pauses after selecting an answer. There is a link available for the high scores section of the page as well.
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript capabilities to implement this idea into code and the result is a user friendly experience that allows people to test their understanding of Javascript functionalities.
